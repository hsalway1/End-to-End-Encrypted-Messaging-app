# END TO END ENCRYPTION MESSAGING APP

### 1. NEED OF THE PROJECT
We can never be sure if the data sent over a network is completely safe from the third parties or not. If a sensitive data is accessed by an unauthorized party, it can be a huge issue. What we need is, it is to encrypt the data on our side before sending the data over a network so that even if the data is accessed by a unethical party, the data will not be in a human readable form and no misuse of the data can be done.

### 2. TECHNOLOGIES
1. Node js, Express JS (Backend)
2. HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript (Frontend)
3. AES encryption algorithm

### 3. AES ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM
1. It stands for Advanced Encryption Standard. It is a specification for the encyrption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology.
2. It can have 10, 12 or 14 rounds which depend on the size of the encryption key.
